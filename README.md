# Building Permit System

A blockchain-based building permit system that allows:

- Property owners to submit building permit applications
- Administrators to approve or reject permit applications
- Transparent tracking of permit status
- Immutable record of all permit applications and decisions
- Verification of permit validity

The system provides a decentralized and transparent way to manage construction permits, reducing fraud and improving efficiency in the construction approval process.
